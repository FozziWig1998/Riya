				<p>Hi! My name is Riya Dave. Currently I am going to be a junior at Metea Valley High School. Basically, you could think of me that nerdy, sterotypical indian who makes everything seem really hard.</p1>
    	<center> <img id = "hobbies" src = "http://creativityforlife.com/wp-content/uploads/hobby-definition600x400PNG.png" alt = "FOOD.... jk I'm just a little hungry" height = "300" width = "400"></center>
    	</img>
    			<p>Well some things that I enjoy doing are drawing, bike riding, and making cards. I also LOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVVEEEEE food and music. I mean duh life without music would be flat and food is the reason you life so basically you have to love it. I'm not good at making the food though (my mom takes care of that stuff) and I'm not the best baker sooooooooooo my sister takes care of the brownies. Actually one time I tried to make these brownies and somehow (even though i'm sure I used the right proportions) the brownies ended up being burnt and really oily (it was disgusting). So yea, I think of myself as a creative being and I enjoy doing many things. Currently I have been exploring computer science stuff and am part of the program called Girls Who Code that has been teaching the basics. We have done many fun things and so far, all the aspects of computer science is fun to me!</p>
